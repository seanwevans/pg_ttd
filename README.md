# pg_ttd

**pg_ttd** is a prototype of an attempt at *OpenTTD inside PostgreSQL*.  
We attempt to reproduce at least part of OpenTTD within a Postgres database.
That is, all simulation, logicâ€”world generation, tile updates, entities, economics, etc 
is implemented as stored procedures and tables in PostgreSQL.
